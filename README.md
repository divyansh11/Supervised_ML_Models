Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on features extracted from a medical dataset. The model uses a logistic regression classifier to provide predictions and insights into the likelihood of cancer diagnosis.

Project Details
Dataset Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
Features: The dataset contains various features related to breast cancer diagnosis, including measurements of cell nuclei, texture, perimeter, area, and more.
Target Variable: diagnosis (Malignant or Benign)

Features Developed
Model Training: Trained a Logistic Regression model on the breast cancer dataset.Used feature scaling to normalize the data and improve model performance.
Feature Selection:Implemented a correlation-based feature selection to drop highly correlated features, improving model efficiency and reducing redundancy.
Confusion Matrix: Visualized the confusion matrix to assess the performance of the model, including metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Streamlit Web Application:
Input Handling: Users can input feature values directly or upload a CSV/Excel file with the required data.
Model Prediction: The application predicts whether the input data indicates cancer or not.
Results Display: Predictions are displayed in a table, and users can download the results as a CSV or Excel file.
Downloadable Template: Provides a downloadable template file for users to fill out and upload, ensuring data is in the correct format.
