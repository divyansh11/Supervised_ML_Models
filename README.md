Problem Statement 1
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on features extracted from a medical dataset. The model uses a logistic regression classifier to provide predictions and insights into the likelihood of cancer diagnosis.

Problem Statement 2
Precision agriculture requires data-driven insights to help farmers make informed crop choices. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset combining rainfall, climate, and fertilizer information from India, this project aims to develop a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops based on various agronomic parameters. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model will enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability, enabling farmers to optimize their farming strategies effectively.
